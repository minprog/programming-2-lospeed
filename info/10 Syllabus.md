# Programmeren 2<br><span class="small">Studiewijzer / Syllabus</span>

*Edition: Lo-speed, Fall 2016*

Introduction to the intellectual enterprises of computer science and the art of programming. This course teaches students how to think algorithmically and solve problems efficiently. Topics include abstraction, algorithms, data structures, encapsulation, resource management, security, software engineering, and web development. Languages include C, PHP, and JavaScript plus SQL, CSS, and HTML. Problem sets inspired by real-world domains of biology, cryptography, finance, forensics, and gaming. Designed for concentrators and non-concentrators alike, with or without prior programming experience.

## Staff

The course's staff is your instructor and many teaching assistants.
You are encouraged to speak to an assistant or the instructor at the lab. Do you have a question from home? Feel free to send an e-mail to <help@mprog.nl>.

## Prerequisites

This course is the second part of a two-course series aimed at students with
*little or no prior programming experience* but a desire to understand
computational approaches to problem solving.

## Expectations

You are expected to watch all lectures, attend all sections, submit four
problem sets, and take a quiz. You are also expected to attend a minimum amount
of lab sessions in order to get you moving quickly through the course.

## Grades

All students must ordinarily submit all four problem sets and take the quiz in
order to be eligible for a satisfactory grade unless granted an exception in
writing by the course's heads.

The final grade for this course is primarily determined by averaging the scores for the problem sets. The final exam has to be passed, but has no weight in the final grade.

Problem sets are evaluated primarily along axes of scope,
correctness, design, and style, with scores ordinarily determined by scope × (3
× correctness + 2 × design + 1 × style). Scope is deemed all-important: we
strive for you to at least try every aspect of each problem set. Mid-semester
comparisons among students of scores are not reliable indicators of standing.

Although you must submit all problem sets, your lowest score among those
problem sets on which you received perfect scores for the axis of scope will be
dropped when final grades are determined.

Know that this course draws quite the spectrum of students, including "those
less comfortable", "those more comfortable", and those somewhere in between.
However, what ultimately matters in this course is not so much where you end up
relative to your classmates but where you end up relative to yourself in Week 0.

The course is not graded on a curve. The course does not have pre-determined
cutoffs for final grades. Those less comfortable and somewhere in between are
not at a disadvantage vis-à-vis those more comfortable. Each student's final
grade is individually determined at term's end after input from the teaching
fellows. Remarkable effort and upward trending are always considered.

## Books

No books are required for this course. However, we do have a number of books
available for you to use in the lab. You are welcome to pick up one of
these and read them as a preparation for or review of one of the lectures. If one seeks additional reference, here are some good suggestions:

*For Those Less Comfortable*

C Programming Absolute Beginner's Guide, Third Edition  
Greg Perry, Dean Miller  
Pearson Education, 2014  
ISBN 0-789-75198-4

*For Those More Comfortable*

Programming in C, Fourth Edition  
Stephen G. Kochan  
Pearson Education, 2015  
ISBN 0-321-77641-0

The book below is recommended for those interested in understanding how their
own computers work for personal edification.

How Computers Work, Ninth Edition  
Ron White  
Que Publishing, 2008  
ISBN 0-7897-3613-6

This last book below is recommended for aspiring hackers, those interested in
programming tricks and low-level optimization of code for applications beyond
the scope of this course.

Hacker's Delight, Second Edition

ISBN 0-321-84268-5

## Lectures

Lectures discuss theory that helps you solve your problems sets and prepare you for the final exam. Watch the lectures before or on your way to the lab sessions, in order to be able to spend your lab time programming and asking questions.

## Sections

Lectures are supplemented by weekly, 90-minute sections led by the teaching assistants. Sections provide you with opportunities to explore the course's material in a more intimate environment, with only your teaching fellow and a group of classmates present, as well as to dive into hands-on activities.

## Walkthroughs

Embedded into problem sets are "walkthroughs," videos via which the course's staff offer direction on where to begin and how to approach a challenge. You are expected to watch walkthroughs while starting with your problem sets.

## Office Hours

Office hours are opportunities for assistance with problem sets alongside the
course's teaching assistants. Office hours ordinarily take place on weekdays, based on group schedules.

## Tutoring

For students who avail themselves of the course's other resources but still
find themselves struggling, the course offers tutoring, to the extent possible,
providing opportunities for students to work with the course's staff one-on-one
or in particularly small groups. To arrange, contact the course's heads.

## Problem Sets

Four problem sets are assigned during the course. Each is due by a pre-set deadline: Friday, just before midnight. Lateness of electronic submissions is determined down to the minute by submissions' timestamps. Submitting more than seven minutes late is equivalent to submitting twenty-four hours late. Late work is not ordinarily accepted, except in cases of medical emergency.

A schedule of problem sets, subject to change, appears below.

| problem set   | language     | due             |  
| ------------- | ------------ | --------------- |  
| Problem Set 5 | C            | 11-Nov at 23:59 |  
| Problem Set 6 | Python       | 25-Nov at 23:59 |  
| Problem Set 7 | Python + SQL | 9-Dec at 23:59  |  
| Problem Set 8 | Javascript   | 16-Dec at 23:59 |  

In order to accommodate students with different backgrounds, some problem sets are released in two editions: a standard edition intended for most students and a "Hacker Edition" intended for some students. Both editions essentially cover the same material. But the Hacker Edition typically presents that material from a more technical angle and poses more sophisticated questions. Hacker Editions are graded separately from standard editions, but those students who submit the former do not receive any form of extra credit outright. When determining grades at term's end, however, we do bear in mind submissions of Hacker Editions.

To be clear, we encourage most students (including aspiring computer scientists) to tackle the standard editions. However, you may choose, week to week, which edition to submit. You may not submit both or some amalgam of the two.

Re-submission of problem sets is not possible until the following semester.

## Quiz

The course has one 75-minute quiz. It is "closed-book," but you may utilize during each quiz one two-sided page (A4) of notes, typed or written, and a pen or pencil, nothing else.

One retake of the quiz is offered, but not neccessarily in time for follow-up courses.

## Collaboration

All work that you do toward fulfillment of this course's expectations must be
your own unless collaboration is explicitly allowed in writing by the course's
instructor. Collaboration in the completion of problem sets is not permitted
unless otherwise stated by some problem set's specification.

Viewing or copying another individual's work (even if left by a printer, stored
in an executable directory, or posted online) or lifting material from a book,
website, or other source—even in part—and presenting it as your own constitutes
academic dishonesty, as does showing or giving your work, even in part, to
another student or soliciting the work of another individual. Similarly is dual
submission academic dishonesty: you may not submit the same or similar work to
this course that you have submitted or will submit to another. Nor may you
provide or make available solutions to problem sets to individuals who take or
may take this course in the future. Moreover, submission of any work that you
intend to use outside of the course (e.g., for a job) must be approved by the
course's instructor.

You are welcome to discuss the course's material with others in order to better
understand it. You may even discuss problem sets with classmates, but you may
not share code. In other words, you may communicate with classmates in English,
but you may not communicate in, say, C. If in doubt as to the appropriateness
of some discussion, contact the course's instructor.

## Quoting sources

You may turn to the Web for instruction beyond the course's lectures and
sections, for references, and for solutions to technical difficulties, but not
for outright solutions to problems on problem sets or your own final project.
However, failure to cite (as with comments) the origin of any code or technique
that you do discover outside of the course's lectures and sections (even while
respecting these constraints) and then integrate into your own work may be
considered academic dishonesty.

## Regulations

All forms of academic dishonesty are dealt with harshly. If the course refers
some matter to the Examination Board, the course reserves the right to impose
local sanctions on top of that outcome for that student that may include, but
not be limited to, a failing grade for work submitted or for the course itself.

In all cases we follow the directives regarding fraud and plagiarism of the
University of Amsterdam and of the examination board of the Computer Science
BSc programme. Find them here in [English] and [Dutch].
